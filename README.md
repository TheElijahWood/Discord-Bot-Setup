We have now finished doing terminal stuff.
Third Step:

Go into package.json file, and change line 9 from "index.js" to "src/bot.js".

Now Create a folder called "src":

Inside the src folder create a file called "bot.js".

4 Step (Code):
Inside the bot.js file copy the code from github it should be named "bot.js".

You do not need require('dotenv').config(); for it to work so get rid of it and get rid of procces.env.token and replace it with your bots token.
