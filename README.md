We have now finished doing terminal stuff.
Third Step:

Go into package.json file, and change line 5 from "index.js" to "src/bot.js".

Now Create a folder called "src":

Inside the src folder create a file called "bot.js".

4 Step (Code):
Inside the bot.js file copy the code from github it should be named "bot.js".

Now get your discord bots token by going to discord developer portal, got to bot then reset token. Once you have the token got to the code and look at the last line of the script then replace 'token' with your bots token that you copied. Once you have done that go to terminal and do "node src/bot.js" check your discord server and you bot will be online!
